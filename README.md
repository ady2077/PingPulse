 PingPulse PingPulse  
A simple tool to check if a website is up or down.  

What It Does  
- Type a URL (e.g., http://google.com) in the input box.  
- Click "Check" to ping the site.  
- Shows "UP!" in green if it responds, "DOWN!" in red if it fails.  

How It Works  
- Uses `fetch()` to try reaching the URL.  
- Adds "https://" if missing (e.g., "http://google.com" becomes "https://google.com").  
- Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScriptâ€”AI wrote the base code, I ran and tweaked it.
